> ## Software
>
> We will use Jupyter notebook to run python. If you have not installed Jupyter notebook, please follow the instructions to install. For both windows and Mac, the easiest way is to install [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (recommend download and install the python 3.7 version). ANACONDA will automatically install python, Jupyter and few packages that are frequently used in data analytics to your computer. You can also choose to use `python -m pip install Jupyter` command to install if you already have python in your computer.
>
> After installing anaconda,
> ### Windows
> - Create a new folder on your desktop called "python_workshop"   
> - Start Anaconda Navigator.
> - Launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator. It will automatically open your browser.
> - Click into python_workshop folder under Files tab.
> ### Macs  
> - Create a new folder "python_workshop" on your user home folder.
> - Start Anaconda Navigator. Search "Anaconda" in Launchpad to find Anaconda Navigator icon.
> - Launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator. It will automatically open your browser.
> - Click into python_workshop folder under Files tab.  
> **Now you successfully have the notebook open!**
