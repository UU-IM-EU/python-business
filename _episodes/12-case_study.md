We will demonstrate how to apply CRISP-DM framework on a real world dataset-Titanic dataset. Download the dataset and notebook template(and solution) from [here](../data/data_code.zip). Please work on notebook  CaseStudy_Titanic_Template.ipynb. You may find solutions for all tasks in CaseStudy_Titanic_Solution.ipynb.

In this case study, We will
- explore the data,
- practice data preparation,
- visualize the data and
- construct a linear regression

Just follow the instructions in the template and finish all the tasks. Please note that this dataset is not a good dataset for regression. We do it just for practice purpose.
