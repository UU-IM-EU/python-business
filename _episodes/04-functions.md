## Function 
What if we want to use some code again,
on a different dataset or at a different point in our program?
Cutting and pasting is going to make our code very long, repetitive, and quickly. 
We'd like a way to package our code so that it is easier to reuse,
and Python provides for this by letting us define things called 'functions' ---
a shorthand way of re-executing longer pieces of code.

A function is reusable code that performs a certain action. 

![function](../pic/function.png){:height="300px"} 

Python has some [built in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). For example, len() is a built in function. <br>

You can also define your own functions. 
The function definition opens with the keyword `def` followed by the
name of the function and a parenthesized list of parameter names. The
[body]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-body) of the function --- the
statements that are executed when it runs --- is indented below the
definition line.

Foe example, in the exercise, you wrote some code to reverse a string. If you want to use it on other strings, you don't have to copy and paste the code. All you have to do is to add a few lines to make it a function: 
~~~
def rev(oldstring):
    newstring = ''
    for char in oldstring:
        newstring = char + newstring
    print(newstring)
    return newstring
~~~
{: .language-python}

When we call the function, the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables, so they will be used inside of the function.
Inside the function,
we use a [return statement]({{ page.root }}/reference/#return-statement) to send a result back to whoever asked for it.
Now you can use it on whatever strings you want like this: 
~~~
rev("string")
~~~
{: .language-python}

This command should call our function, using "string" as the input and return the function value.

## Modules   

While a lot of powerful, general tools are built into languages like Python,
specialized tools built up from these basic units live in modules that can be called upon when needed.

A [module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions, you can include a module with `import` statement. 
For example, Python does not provide a built in function for square root. Of course, you can write a function that do square root by yourself. But the good thing is, the function is included in the built in `math` module. You can import the `math` module by:  
```
import math
math.sqrt(7)
```
Too see what we can do with the module, we can read its [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html). Modules usually have clearly stated documentations that tells you what functions are included and how to use them. To use the functions, you do `module_name.function_name()`. 

A cool thing about Python is that there are a lot of modules available for you to perform various kinds of tasks. For example, there are modules that do statistics, graphing, charts, etc. Many useful functions are pre written, and you just have to find the modules and import them. 
Note that not all modules are included in your Python package in the beginning. Sometimes you have to download the module before importing it. For example, there is a cool graphing module called `plotly`. If you simply do `import plotly`, it will fail because the file is not in your computer yet. You can download it by using the `!pip install` statement: 

```
!pip install plotly
```
After that, you will be able to import the module. They way to install outside packages varies. `!pip install` is just one of the most common ways. You should always check the installation guide in the documentation of the packages.  

> ## Challenge 2.2

> Hint 2: power of two can be achieved by using `** 2`

> # you can test your code with the following:  
> lt = [1,2,3,4,5,7]
> your_function_name(lt)  
> it should return 1.9720265943665387

{: .challenge}

An alternative is that you can import the [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) module, and the standard deviation function is pre written for you. 
```
import scipy
scipy.std(lt)
```
So much easier.  
As business students, you don't really have to actually implement functions such as standard deviation, PCA (detention reduction) and some probabilistic models at detailed level because they are usually pre written in some modules. Of course, it will never hurt if you are interested in learning them so that you can write your customized function to better fit your tasks (path way to an engineer). However, for most of us, it is more helpful to learn what kind of analysis we need for a certain task, what modules can perform the analysis, and how to use the functions in the modules. To find modules, you can first google your task, and go to the module's website to read the documentations. 

## Readable functions

Consider this function:

~~~
def s(p):
    a = avg(p)
    t = 0
    for q in p: 
        t = t + (q - a) ** 2
    return math.sqrt(t/len(p))
~~~
{: .language-python}

The functions `s` actually calculates standard deviation, exactly the same as the previous exercise. 
But to a human reader, it is difficult to read.  

As this example illustrates, both documentation and a programmer's
_coding style_ combine to determine how easy it is for others to read
and understand the programmer's code. Choosing meaningful variable
names and using blank spaces to break the code into logical "chunks"
are helpful techniques for producing _readable code_. This is useful
not only for sharing code with others, but also for the original
programmer. (Especially for Python, it can get really messy because there are so many short cuts and tricks... So please also keep commenting in your code) 
If you need to revisit code that you wrote months ago and
haven't thought about since then, you will appreciate the value of
readable code!
