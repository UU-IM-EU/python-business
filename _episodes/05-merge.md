## Merge database

When we have data stored in different data sets, it is frequently helpful to combine the data to provide deeper insight into system behavior.  We need to _merge_ the databasesâ€”and it turns out that there are several ways to think about this problem.

At a minimum, the databases have to have a _join column_, which is the set of values which are common to both data sets.  Without these values, there is no way to relate the data sets to each other.

Merging data sets is equivalent to using lookup functions like `VLOOKUP` in a spreadsheet.  For example, consider these two tables:

![vlookup1](../pic/vlookup1.png){:height="130px"}

And we want to merge them together:

![vlookup1](../pic/vlookup2.png){:height="130px"}

Using a spreadsheet, you end up with a relationship like this,

```Excel
=VLOOKUP(A3,$E$3:$F$5,2,FALSE)
```

which is fairly concise but obscures what the tables actually represent and how they are organized.

We will carry out this operation in Pandas with [`pandas.DataFrame.merge`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html).

```python
DataFrame.merge(Another_DataFrame, how='inner, outer, left or right', left_on="Left_Join_Column_Name", right_on="Right_Join_Column_Name", ...)
```

`DataFrame` and its counterpart are straightforward, but what about `how`?  `how` determines the join type.  Assuming column `J` is the column on which the data sets are to be merged, consider the following ways of putting data together:

![join](../pic/join.png){:height="400px"}

_Instructors:  now is a good time to draw these out on the board, perhaps using address and ZIP code lookups._

Let's have a quick demonstration of the merges performed in the charts above.

```python
# firstly, load in the tables
table1 = pd.DataFrame({'J': ['A', 'B', 'D'], 'X': [1, 2, 3]})
table2 = pd.DataFrame({'J': ['B', 'C', 'D'], 'Y': [4, 5, 6]})
```

Each join is specified simply using `how`:

```python
# inner join
table1.merge(table2, how="inner", right_on="J", left_on="J")
# outer join
table1.merge(table2, how="outer", right_on="J", left_on="J")
# left join
table1.merge(table2, how="left", right_on="J", left_on="J")
# right join
table1.merge(table2, how="right", right_on="J", left_on="J")
```

Revisiting our data, we have two `DataFrame`s:  `soda` and `invoice`.  What is common to both of these?

In the `invoice` `DataFrame`, the only information about soda is the `"Item_id"` column.  If we want to see details of the soft drink associated with each invoice, we need to join the two tables together.  Since the `soda` `DataFrame` also has `"Item_id"` column, only that column can be used as the join column.

## Aggregate Function

Let's suppose now that we want to summarize our data set, for instance by finding the number of bottles of each soft drink that has been sold.  In a spreadsheet, we would use a pivot table to start to tease out multivariable summaries.  In Pandas, we will use the `groupby` function. Once we've created a `groupby` `DataFrame`, we can quickly calculate summary statistics by a grouping of our choice.

```python
# Group data by Item_Description
# The code below counts the number of invoice_id associated with each Item_Description. You can have other
grouped_df = inv_soda.groupby('Item_Description').agg({"Invoice_id":"count"})
grouped_df
```

You should see a table which begins:

```python
                      Invoice_id
Item_Description
Ace's Energy          262
Ace's Energy Booster  64
Akame's Energy        80
...
```

`"Item_Description"` and `"Invoice_id"` are not at the same level.  This is because the `groupby` function automatically made "Item_Description" the index (as with `index_col`).  Thus if we use `grouped_df.columns`, we will only see the `"Invoice_id"` column. To avoid problems when using the aggregated result, we might want to:

```python
grouped_df = inv_soda.groupby('Item_Description', as_index=False).agg({"Invoice_id":"count"})
grouped_df
```

The columns are at the same level now.

```
  Item_Description        Invoice_id
0 Ace's Energy            262
1 Ace's Energy Booster    64
2 Akame's Energy          80
...
```

In this case, if you use `grouped_df.columns`, both `"Item_Description"` and `"Invoice_id"` will show up.  These are broadly equivalent, so you can use whichever you prefer.

The `"count"` column has the name of the counted column, or `"Invoice_id"`.  This is confusing, so you should change it to a more descriptive name with the `rename()` function.

```python
inv_soda.groupby('Item_Description', as_index=False).agg({'Invoice_id':'count'}).rename(columns={'Invoice_id':'Count'})
```

Our final output is:

```
  Item_Description        Count
0 Ace's Energy            262
1 Ace's Energy Booster    64
2 Akame's Energy          80
...
```

> Note that the input in `.agg()` is a dictionary.  We can, in fact, generate multiple aggregate columns at the same time.
>
> ```python
> inv_soda.groupby('Item_Description', as_index=False).agg({"Invoice_id":"count", "Bottle_Cost":"mean"})
> ```
{.callout}

> ## Finding Averages per Category
>
> Find the average `Bottle_Cost` and `Bottle_Retail_Price` for each category
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```
> > inv_soda.groupby('Category', as_index=False).agg({"Bottle_Cost":"mean","Bottle_Retail_Price":"mean"})
> > ```
> {: .solution}

## Pivot Tables

Spreadsheets perhaps show their power as summarization tools best in the pivot table.  Pivot tables let you summarize quantities from many variables in many different ways.  Of course, we are able to create something similar using Pandas.

A basic pivot table contains the following parameters:

```python
pandas.pivot_table(DataFrame, values, index, columns, aggfunc)
# values: columns to aggregate (like choosing the field to report in Excel's pivot table)
# index: keys to group by on the pivot table index (just like dragging into the row box in Excel's pivot table)
# columns: keys to group by on the pivot table column (just like dragging into the column box in Excel's pivot table)
# aggfunc: aggregate function, for example, mean, sum, min, etc. (just like setting the values box in Excel;s pivot table)
```

For instance, to see the total bottles sold for each soft drink by city:

```python
pd.pivot_table(inv_soda, values="Bottles_Sold", index = ["Item_Description"],\
            columns = ["City_Name"], aggfunc="sum")
```

![pt](../pic/pivot.png){:height="300px"}

> ## Pivot Table for Bottles Sold by Vendor
>
> Create a pivot table that shows the total number of bottles sold from each vendor in each category.  Set `"Vendor_Name"` as the index and `"Category"` as the columns.

            columns = ["Category"], aggfunc="sum")
