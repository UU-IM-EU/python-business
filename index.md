### Welcome

This workshop is designed to help business students acquire data processing skills that are:

- automated
- repeatable
- testable

through using Python as an adjunct for (or replacement to) a spreadsheet.  We cover dealing with tabular data, basic statistical tests, plotting, pivot tables, and more.


> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including the working directory) and how to start a Python
> interpreter before tackling this lesson. This lesson references the Jupyter (IPython)
> Notebook although it can be taught through any Python interpreter.
> The commands in this lesson pertain to **Python 3**.
