### Welcome
This workshop is designed to help you (business students) go through some basic Python programming skills. <br>
Many of you are Excel experts. In this workshop, you will learn how to deal with table-like data in Python, without a graphical interface. <br>
The workshop covers a lot of materials. So don't worry if you can't remember everything in the end. We will help you go through the material once, and you can always review the website in the future. 

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including the working directory) and how to start a Python
> interpreter before tackling this lesson. This lesson references the Jupyter (IPython)
> Notebook although it can be taught through any Python interpreter.
> The commands in this lesson pertain to **Python 3**.
