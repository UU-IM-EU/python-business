## Overall

This lesson is written as an introduction to Python,
but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming:
how to solve problems by building functions,
each of which can fit in a programmer's working memory.
In order to teach that,
we must teach people a little about
the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O
so that their functions can do things they actually care about.
Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced;
instructors should resist the temptation to explain
the "other 90%" of the language
as well.

Since these lessons are voiced towards business students with previous experience using spreadsheets, it is frequently helpful to preface your discussion of any new topic with a reference to the spreadsheet operation.  By showing the Excel analogue first, many students more quickly grasp what is being taught because they have a way to analogize around the problem.

1. Show (or ask) how to carry out a task using Excel.
2. Show the task in Python.
3. Extend the task using Python.
4. Ask how to carry out the extension in Excelâ€”this is often not straightforward, particularly as tasks get more complex.

Explain that we use Python because:

*   It's free.
*   It has a lot of scientific libraries, and more are constantly being added.
*   It has a large scientific user community.
*   It's easier for novices to learn than most of the mature alternatives.

Watching the instructor grow programs step by step
is as helpful to learners as anything to do with Python.
Resist the urge to update a single cell repeatedly
(which is what you'd probably do in real life).
Instead,
clone the previous cell and write the update in the new copy
so that learners have a complete record of how the program grew.
Once you've done this,
you can say,
"Now why don't we just break things into small functions right from the start?"

The discussion of command-line scripts
assumes that students understand standard I/O and building filters,
which are covered in the lesson on the shell.

## Frequently Argued Issues (FAI)

*   `import ... as ...` syntax.

    This syntax is commonly used in the scientific Python community;
    it is explicitly recommended in documentation to `import numpy as np`
    and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. Despite that, we have decided
    not to introduce aliasing imports in this novice lesson due to the
    additional cognitive load it puts on students, despite the typing that
    it saves. A good summary of arguments for and against can be found in
    [PR #61](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/pull/61).

    It is up to you as an individual instructor whether you want to introduce
    these aliases when you teach this lesson, but we encourage you to please
    read those arguments thoroughly before deciding one way or the other.

*   NumPy methods.

    We used to use NumPy array methods in the first [NumPy topic]({{ page.root }}/01-numpy/).
    We switched these methods to the equivalent functions because a majority
    of instructors supported the change; see
    [PR #244](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/pull/244)
    for detailed arguments for and against the change.

*   Underscores vs. hyphens in filenames

    We used to use hyphens in filenames in order to signify that these Python
    files should only be run as scripts and never imported. However, after some
    [discussion](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/pull/254),
    including an informal Twitter poll, we switched over to underscores because
    many files that start off as Python scripts end up being imported eventually.
    For that reason, we also added `if __name__ == '__main__'` guards around
    `main()` calls, which is how real-world Python scripts ensure that imports
    do not result in side-effects.

After discussing the challenges is a good time to introduce the `b *= 2` syntax.
